OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)

<br><br>• What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)? Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code in the form of procedures (often known as methods). OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them.<br>
<br><br>• What is Procedural Programming? Procedural programming is a programming paradigm that uses a linear or top-down approach. It is based on the concept of procedure calls, where statements are structured into procedures (also known as routines or subroutines).<br>
<br><br>• Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and how does it differ from procedural programming? OOP differs from procedural programming in that it organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. OOP models real-world entities as software objects that have some data associated with them and can perform certain functions. Procedural programming, on the other hand, is structured around functions and logic flows.<br>
<br><br>• The concept of classes in Python. A class in Python is a blueprint for creating objects. A class defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects can have. It allows bundling of data and functionality together.<br>
<br><br>• Public, Private, and Protected Members in Python Classes.<br>
• Public Members: Accessible from anywhere.<br>
• Private Members: Accessible only within the class where they are defined. They are defined with double underscores (__).<br>
• Protected Members: Accessible within the class and its subclasses. They are defined with a single underscore (_).<br>
<br><br>• The concept of objects in Python. Objects are instances of classes. An object is created using the class constructor and can have attributes (variables) and methods (functions) defined by the class.<br>
<br><br>• Constructor Method (init) in Python. The init method in Python is a special method that gets called when an object is instantiated. It is used to initialize the object's attributes.<br>
<br><br>• Destructor Method (del) in Python. The del method in Python is a special method that gets called when an object is about to be destroyed. It is used to clean up resources before the object is removed from memory.<br>
<br><br>• How is encapsulation implemented in Python? Provide an example. Encapsulation in Python is implemented using private and protected access specifiers. Example:<br>
class Example:<br>
def init(self, value):<br>
self.__private_value = value # private variable<br>
self._protected_value = value # protected variable<br>
def get_private_value(self):<br>
return self.__private_value<br>
def set_private_value(self, value):<br>
self.__private_value = value<br>
<br><br>• What is inheritance in Python? Give an example of a simple inheritance hierarchy. Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class. Example:<br>
class Parent:<br>
def init(self, name):<br>
self.name = name<br>
def display_name(self):<br>
print(self.name)<br>
class Child(Parent):<br>
def init(self, name, age):<br>
super().init(name)<br>
self.age = age<br>
def display_age(self):<br>
print(self.age)<br>
<br><br>• Single Inheritance in Python. Single inheritance allows a class to inherit from one superclass. Example:<br>
class Parent:<br>
pass<br>
class Child(Parent):<br>
pass<br>
<br><br>• Multiple Inheritance in Python. Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one superclass. Example:<br>
class Parent1:<br>
pass<br>
class Parent2:<br>
pass<br>
class Child(Parent1, Parent2):<br>
pass<br>
<br><br>• Multilevel Inheritance in Python. Multilevel inheritance is a type of inheritance where a class inherits from a class that inherits from another class. Example:<br>
class Grandparent:<br>
pass<br>
class Parent(Grandparent):<br>
pass<br>
class Child(Parent):<br>
pass<br>
<br><br>• Hierarchical Inheritance in Python. Hierarchical inheritance is a type of inheritance where multiple classes inherit from a single superclass. Example:<br>
class Parent:<br>
pass<br>
class Child1(Parent):<br>
pass<br>
class Child2(Parent):<br>
pass<br>
<br><br>• super() Function in Python Inheritance. The super() function is used to call the parent class's methods. Example:<br>
class Parent:<br>
def init(self):<br>
self.value = "Parent"<br>
class Child(Parent):<br>
def init(self):<br>
super().init()<br>
print(self.value)<br>
<br><br>• Composition in Python. Composition is a design principle where one class contains an object of another class. Example:<br>
class Engine:<br>
def start(self):<br>
print("Engine started")<br>
class Car:<br>
def init(self):<br>
self.engine = Engine()<br>
def start(self):<br>
self.engine.start()<br>
<br><br>• Aggregation in Python. Aggregation is a type of association where one class owns another class, but both can exist independently. Example:<br>
class Department:<br>
pass<br>
class Employee:<br>
def init(self, department):<br>
self.department = department<br>
<br><br>• Association in Python. Association is a relationship between two classes where they use each other’s functionalities but can exist independently. Example:<br>
class Teacher:<br>
def init(self, name):<br>
self.name = name<br>
class Course:<br>
def init(self, title):<br>
self.title = title<br>
<br><br>• Importance of polymorphism in OOP. Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It is important for flexibility and the ability to use a single interface for different underlying forms (data types).<br>
<br><br>• What is the purpose of the init method in Python classes? The init method initializes an object's state by setting initial values for its attributes.<br>
<br><br>• How do you achieve method overloading in Python? Python does not support traditional method overloading. Instead, default arguments and variable-length arguments are used to achieve similar functionality.<br>
def greet(name, message="Hello"):<br>
print(f"{message}, {name}")<br>
<br><br>• Magic Methods (Special Methods) in Python. Magic methods in Python are special methods that start and end with double underscores. They allow customization of class behavior. Examples include init, str, repr.<br>
<br><br>• str and repr Methods in Python.<br>
• str: Returns a human-readable string representation of an object.<br>
• repr: Returns an unambiguous string representation of an object, often used for debugging.<br>
<br><br>• len and getitem Methods in Python.<br>
• len: Returns the length of an object.<br>
• getitem: Retrieves an item from a collection using indexing.<br>
<br><br>• add and sub Methods in Python.<br>
• add: Defines the behavior for the + operator.<br>
• sub: Defines the behavior for the - operator.<br>
<br><br>• Class and Static Methods in Python.<br>
• Class methods: Defined using @classmethod, take cls as the first parameter, and can modify class state.<br>
• Static methods: Defined using @staticmethod, do not modify class or instance state.<br>
<br><br>• @classmethod and @staticmethod Decorators in Python.<br>
• @classmethod: Used to define a method bound to the class and not the instance.<br>
• @staticmethod: Used to define a method that does not access or modify class or instance state.<br>
<br><br>• Explain the difference between class variables and instance variables in Python.<br>
• Class variables: Shared by all instances of the class.<br>
• Instance variables: Unique to each instance.<br>
<br><br>• Discuss the concept of method overriding and provide an example in Python. Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass.<br>
class Parent:<br>
def greet(self):<br>
print("Hello from Parent")<br>
class Child(Parent):<br>
def greet(self):<br>
print("Hello from Child")<br>
<br><br>• Explain the concept of an interface in OOP and how it is implemented in Python. An interface in OOP is a contract that defines a set of methods that implementing classes must provide. In Python, interfaces can be implemented using abstract base classes (ABCs) from the abc module.<br>
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod<br>
class MyInterface(ABC):<br>
@abstractmethod<br>
def my_method(self):<br>
pass<br>
class MyClass(MyInterface):<br>
def my_method(self):<br>
print("Implementation")<br>
<br><br>• How do you create abstract classes in Python? Abstract classes in Python are created using the abc module and the @abstractmethod decorator.<br>
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod<br>
class MyAbstractClass(ABC):<br>
@abstractmethod<br>
def my_method(self):<br>
pass<br>
<br><br>• Abstract Base Classes (ABC) in Python. Abstract Base Classes provide a way to define abstract classes in Python, allowing a class to define methods that must be created within any child classes built from the abstract class.<br>
<br><br>• How do you implement polymorphism using abstract classes in Python? Polymorphism can be implemented using abstract classes by defining a common interface and providing different implementations in derived classes.<br>
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod<br>
class Shape(ABC):<br>
@abstractmethod<br>
def area(self):<br>
pass<br>
class Circle(Shape):<br>
def area(self):<br>
return 3.14 * (self.radius ** 2)<br>
class Square(Shape):<br>
def area(self):<br>
return self.side ** 2<br>
<br><br>• Explain the concept of multiple inheritance and how it is handled in Python. Multiple inheritance is the ability of a class to inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. In Python, it is handled by specifying multiple base classes in the class definition.<br>
class Base1:<br>
pass<br>
class Base2:<br>
pass<br>
class Derived(Base1, Base2):<br>
pass<br>
<br><br>• How do you handle method resolution in case of multiple inheritance in Python? Method resolution in Python is handled using the Method Resolution Order (MRO), which follows the C3 linearization algorithm. You can view the MRO of a class using the mro attribute or the mro() method.<br>
class Base1:<br>
def greet(self):<br>
print("Hello from Base1")<br>
class Base2:<br>
def greet(self):<br>
print("Hello from Base2")<br>
class Derived(Base1, Base2):<br>
pass<br>
d = Derived()<br>
print(Derived.mro)<br>
d.greet()<br>
<br><br>• Explain the diamond problem in multiple inheritance. The diamond problem occurs when a class inherits from two classes that have a common base class, leading to ambiguity in the inheritance hierarchy. Python handles this using the C3 linearization algorithm to ensure a consistent method resolution order.<br>
class A:<br>
pass<br>
class B(A):<br>
pass<br>
class C(A):<br>
pass<br>
class D(B, C):<br>
pass<br>
<br><br>• What are mixin classes and how are they used in Python? Mixin classes are used to add specific functionality to a class through inheritance. They are designed to be combined with other classes to create a new class with combined functionality.<br>
class Mixin1:<br>
def mixin_method1(self):<br>
print("Mixin1 method")<br>
class Mixin2:<br>
def mixin_method2(self):<br>
print("Mixin2 method")<br>
class MyClass(Mixin1, Mixin2):<br>
pass<br>
<br><br>• What is the difference between composition and inheritance in Python?<br>
• Composition: A design principle where a class contains an object of another class, promoting code reuse and flexibility.<br>
• Inheritance: A design principle where a class inherits attributes and methods from a parent class, promoting code reuse and a hierarchical relationship.<br>
<br><br>• Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using inheritance in Python.<br>
• Advantages: Code reuse, logical structure, and polymorphism.<br>
• Disadvantages: Increased complexity, tight coupling, and potential for the diamond problem.<br>
<br><br>• Explain the concept of duck typing in Python. Duck typing is a concept where the type or class of an object is determined by its behavior (methods and properties) rather than its explicit inheritance from a specific class.<br>
class Duck:<br>
def quack(self):<br>
print("Quack")<br>
class Person:<br>
def quack(self):<br>
print("Person pretending to be a duck")<br>
def make_quack(duck):<br>
duck.quack()<br>
d = Duck()<br>
p = Person()<br>
make_quack(d)<br>
make_quack(p)<br>
<br><br>• How do you handle exceptions in Python? Exceptions in Python are handled using try-except blocks. Example:<br>
try:<br>
value = 10 / 0<br>
except ZeroDivisionError:<br>
print("Division by zero error")<br>
<br><br>• What are custom exceptions in Python and how do you create them? Custom exceptions are user-defined exceptions that extend the base Exception class. Example:<br>
class MyException(Exception):<br>
pass<br>
try:<br>
raise MyException("An error occurred")<br>
except MyException as e:<br>
print(e)<br>

PostgreSQL

<br><br>• What is PostgreSQL and what are its key features? PostgreSQL is an open-source, object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) known for its robustness, extensibility, and standards compliance. Key features include support for advanced data types, full ACID compliance, MVCC, and extensibility through custom functions and extensions.<br>
<br><br>• How does PostgreSQL differ from other relational database management systems (RDBMS)? PostgreSQL differs from other RDBMS by its support for advanced data types, extensibility, and compliance with SQL standards.<br>
<br><br>• Explain the architecture of PostgreSQL, including the major components and their roles. The architecture of PostgreSQL includes components such as the postmaster, background processes, shared memory, and the database itself. The postmaster is the main server process that handles connections, the background processes handle tasks like writing to disk, and shared memory is used for caching and inter-process communication.<br>
<br><br>• How do you install PostgreSQL on a Unix-based system? Installation involves updating the package lists, installing the PostgreSQL package, and starting the PostgreSQL service. Example commands:<br>
sudo apt update<br>
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib<br>
sudo systemctl start postgresql<br>
<br><br>• Discuss the process of creating a new database and user in PostgreSQL. Creating a new database and user involves using the createdb and createuser commands or executing SQL commands within the psql interface. Example:<br>
createdb mydatabase<br>
createuser myuser --interactive<br>
<br><br>• How do you connect to a PostgreSQL database using the psql command-line tool? You can connect to a database using the psql command followed by the database name, username, and host information. Example:<br>
psql -U myuser -d mydatabase -h localhost<br>
<br><br>• What are the different data types available in PostgreSQL? PostgreSQL supports a wide range of data types including integer, floating-point, string, boolean, date/time, arrays, JSON, and custom types using the CREATE TYPE command.<br>
<br><br>• Explain the concept of tablespaces in PostgreSQL and how to create one. Tablespaces in PostgreSQL are locations on disk where database objects are stored. They allow database administrators to manage disk layout. Example of creating a tablespace:<br>
CREATE TABLESPACE mytablespace LOCATION '/mnt/data/pgdata';<br>
<br><br>• How do you perform backup and restore operations in PostgreSQL? Backup and restore operations can be performed using pg_dump and pg_restore for logical backups, or pg_basebackup for physical backups. Example:<br>
pg_dump mydatabase > mydatabase.sql<br>
psql mydatabase < mydatabase.sql<br>
<br><br>• What is the Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) in PostgreSQL and why is it important? WAL is a logging mechanism that ensures data integrity by recording changes before they are applied. It allows for crash recovery and supports replication.<br>
<br><br>• How do you set up streaming replication in PostgreSQL? Setting up streaming replication involves configuring the primary server to allow replication connections and setting up a standby server to connect and replicate data. Example steps:<br>

Configure primary server (postgresql.conf):<br>
wal_level = replica<br>
max_wal_senders = 3<br>
Configure primary server (pg_hba.conf):<br>
host replication replicator 192.168.1.0/24 md5<br>
Initialize the standby server:<br>
pg_basebackup -h primary_host -D /var/lib/postgresql/12/main -U replicator -Fp -Xs -P<br>
Start the standby server:<br>
pg_ctl start -D /var/lib/postgresql/12/main<br>
<br><br>• Discuss the concept of MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control) in PostgreSQL. MVCC is a concurrency control method that allows multiple transactions to access the database concurrently without locking. It provides each transaction with a "snapshot" of the database at a certain point in time.<br>
<br><br>• Explain the use of indexes in PostgreSQL and how to create them. Indexes in PostgreSQL improve query performance by providing faster data retrieval. They can be created using the CREATE INDEX command. Example:<br>
CREATE INDEX myindex ON mytable (mycolumn);<br>
<br><br>• What are the different types of indexes available in PostgreSQL? PostgreSQL supports several types of indexes including B-tree, Hash, GiST, SP-GiST, GIN, and BRIN indexes.<br>
<br><br>• How do you analyze and optimize query performance in PostgreSQL? Query performance can be analyzed using the EXPLAIN and EXPLAIN ANALYZE commands. Optimization techniques include creating indexes, optimizing queries, and tuning database parameters.<br>

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW myview AS SELECT * FROM mytable;<br>
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW myview;<br>
<br><br>• How do you handle locking in PostgreSQL? Locking in PostgreSQL is managed automatically, but you can use explicit locking commands like LOCK TABLE and SELECT FOR UPDATE. Locking modes include shared, exclusive, and advisory locks.<br>
<br><br>• What is the purpose of the pg_hba.conf file in PostgreSQL? The pg_hba.conf file controls client authentication, defining which users can connect to which databases from which hosts, and how they must authenticate.<br>
<br><br>• How do you manage user privileges and roles in PostgreSQL? User privileges and roles are managed using the GRANT and REVOKE commands. Roles can be assigned to users to manage permissions. Example:<br>
GRANT SELECT ON mytable TO myuser;<br>
REVOKE INSERT ON mytable FROM myuser;<br>
<br><br>• Explain the concept of schemas in PostgreSQL and how to create and use them. Schemas are logical containers for database objects, allowing for organization and management of database objects. Schemas can be created using the CREATE SCHEMA command. Example:<br>
CREATE SCHEMA myschema;<br>
<br><br>• How do you perform database maintenance tasks such as vacuuming and reindexing in PostgreSQL? Database maintenance tasks include vacuuming to reclaim storage and reindexing to rebuild indexes. Examples:<br>
VACUUM mytable;<br>
REINDEX TABLE mytable;<br>
<br><br>• Discuss the different types of constraints available in PostgreSQL. Constraints enforce data integrity rules. Types include PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, NOT NULL, and CHECK constraints.<br>
<br><br>• How do you handle JSON data in PostgreSQL? PostgreSQL supports JSON data types and provides functions and operators to query and manipulate JSON data. Example:<br>
CREATE TABLE mytable (data JSONB);<br>
INSERT INTO mytable (data) VALUES ('{"key": "value"}');<br>
SELECT data->>'key' FROM mytable;<br>
<br><br>• What is the role of the PostgreSQL planner and optimizer? The planner and optimizer analyze SQL queries and determine the most efficient execution plan based on statistics and available indexes.<br>
<br><br>• How do you handle transactions in PostgreSQL? Transactions in PostgreSQL are handled using the BEGIN, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK commands to ensure data consistency and integrity.<br>
<br><br>• Explain the concept of foreign keys and how to create them in PostgreSQL. Foreign keys enforce referential integrity between tables. They are created using the FOREIGN KEY constraint. Example:<br>
CREATE TABLE orders (<br>
order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,<br>
customer_id INT,<br>
FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers (customer_id)<br>
);<br>
<br><br>• What are stored procedures and functions in PostgreSQL? Stored procedures and functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They can be created using the CREATE FUNCTION and CREATE PROCEDURE commands.<br>
<br><br>• How do you handle full-text search in PostgreSQL? Full-text search in PostgreSQL is handled using the tsvector and tsquery data types, along with functions like to_tsvector and to_tsquery. Example:<br>
SELECT to_tsvector('simple', 'PostgreSQL full text search') @@ to_tsquery('PostgreSQL & text');<br>
<br><br>• Explain the use of sequences in PostgreSQL and how to create them. Sequences are used to generate unique numeric values, often for primary keys. They are created using the CREATE SEQUENCE command. Example:<br>
CREATE SEQUENCE mysequence;<br>
SELECT nextval('mysequence');<br>
<br><br>• How do you configure and manage logging in PostgreSQL? Logging is configured using parameters in the postgresql.conf file, such as log_destination and logging_collector. Logs can be managed by rotating and archiving them.<br>
<br><br>• Discuss the different levels of transaction isolation in PostgreSQL. Transaction isolation levels include Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, and Serializable, which define the visibility of changes made by concurrent transactions.<br>
<br><br>• What is the purpose of the postgresql.conf file and how do you modify its settings? The postgresql.conf file is the main configuration file for PostgreSQL, containing settings for database parameters. Settings can be modified by editing the file and reloading the configuration.<br>
<br><br>• How do you set up SSL/TLS for securing PostgreSQL connections? SSL/TLS can be set up by configuring parameters in the postgresql.conf file and providing the necessary certificates and keys. Example settings:<br>
ssl = on<br>
ssl_cert_file = 'server.crt'<br>
ssl_key_file = 'server.key'<br>
<br><br>• Explain the concept of point-in-time recovery (PITR) in PostgreSQL. PITR allows you to restore the database to a specific point in time by replaying WAL files. It involves taking a base backup and applying WAL files up to the desired recovery point.<br>
<br><br>• What are common performance tuning techniques in PostgreSQL? Performance tuning techniques include optimizing queries, indexing, configuring memory settings, and analyzing query plans.<br>
<br><br>• How do you create and use triggers in PostgreSQL? Triggers are created using the CREATE TRIGGER command and are used to automatically execute a function in response to certain events on a table. Example:<br>
CREATE TRIGGER mytrigger<br>
AFTER INSERT ON mytable<br>
FOR EACH ROW<br>
EXECUTE FUNCTION myfunction();<br>
<br><br>• Discuss the use of extensions in PostgreSQL and how to install them. Extensions add additional functionality to PostgreSQL. They can be installed using the CREATE EXTENSION command. Example:<br>
CREATE EXTENSION pgcrypto;<br>
<br><br>• How do you monitor PostgreSQL performance and health? Monitoring can be done using tools like pg_stat_activity, pg_stat_database, and third-party monitoring solutions like pgAdmin, Nagios, and Zabbix.<br>
