• What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)? Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code in the form of procedures (often known as methods). OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them.<br>
• What is Procedural Programming? Procedural programming is a programming paradigm that uses a linear or top-down approach. It is based on the concept of procedure calls, where statements are structured into procedures (also known as routines or subroutines).<br>
• Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and how does it differ from procedural programming? OOP differs from procedural programming in that it organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. OOP models real-world entities as software objects that have some data associated with them and can perform certain functions. Procedural programming, on the other hand, is structured around functions and logic flows.<br>
• The concept of classes in Python. A class in Python is a blueprint for creating objects. A class defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects can have. It allows bundling of data and functionality together.<br>
• Public, Private, and Protected Members in Python Classes.<br>
• Public Members: Accessible from anywhere.<br>
• Private Members: Accessible only within the class where they are defined. They are defined with double underscores (__).<br>
• Protected Members: Accessible within the class and its subclasses. They are defined with a single underscore (_).<br>
• The concept of objects in Python. Objects are instances of classes. An object is created using the class constructor and can have attributes (variables) and methods (functions) defined by the class.<br>
• Constructor Method (init) in Python. The init method in Python is a special method that gets called when an object is instantiated. It is used to initialize the object's attributes.<br>
• Destructor Method (del) in Python. The del method in Python is a special method that gets called when an object is about to be destroyed. It is used to clean up resources before the object is removed from memory.<br>
• How is encapsulation implemented in Python? Provide an example. Encapsulation in Python is implemented using private and protected access specifiers. Example:<br>

python

class Example:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.__private_value = value  # private variable
        self._protected_value = value  # protected variable

    def get_private_value(self):
        return self.__private_value

    def set_private_value(self, value):
        self.__private_value = value
• What is inheritance in Python? Give an example of a simple inheritance hierarchy. Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class. Example:<br>

python

class Parent:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def display_name(self):
        print(self.name)

class Child(Parent):
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        super().__init__(name)
        self.age = age

    def display_age(self):
        print(self.age)
• Single Inheritance in Python. Single inheritance allows a class to inherit from one superclass. Example:<br>

python

class Parent:
    pass

class Child(Parent):
    pass
• Multiple Inheritance in Python. Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one superclass. Example:<br>

python

class Parent1:
    pass

class Parent2:
    pass

class Child(Parent1, Parent2):
    pass
• Multilevel Inheritance in Python. Multilevel inheritance is a type of inheritance where a class inherits from a class that inherits from another class. Example:<br>

python

class Grandparent:
    pass

class Parent(Grandparent):
    pass

class Child(Parent):
    pass
• Hierarchical Inheritance in Python. Hierarchical inheritance is a type of inheritance where multiple classes inherit from a single superclass. Example:<br>

python

class Parent:
    pass

class Child1(Parent):
    pass

class Child2(Parent):
    pass
• super() Function in Python Inheritance. The super() function is used to call the parent class's methods. Example:<br>

python

class Parent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = "Parent"

class Child(Parent):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        print(self.value)
• Composition in Python. Composition is a design principle where one class contains an object of another class. Example:<br>

python

class Engine:
    def start(self):
        print("Engine started")

class Car:
    def __init__(self):
        self.engine = Engine()

    def start(self):
        self.engine.start()
• Aggregation in Python. Aggregation is a type of association where one class owns another class, but both can exist independently. Example:<br>

python

class Department:
    pass

class Employee:
    def __init__(self, department):
        self.department = department
• Association in Python. Association is a relationship between two classes where they use each other’s functionalities but can exist independently. Example:<br>

python

class Teacher:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

class Course:
    def __init__(self, title):
        self.title = title

# Association: Teacher teaches Course
• Importance of polymorphism in OOP. Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It is important for flexibility and the ability to use a single interface for different underlying forms (data types).<br>
• What is the purpose of the init method in Python classes? The init method initializes an object's state by setting initial values for its attributes.<br>
• How do you achieve method overloading in Python? Python does not support traditional method overloading. Instead, default arguments and variable-length arguments are used to achieve similar functionality.<br>

python

def greet(name, message="Hello"):
    print(f"{message}, {name}")
• Magic Methods (Special Methods) in Python. Magic methods in Python are special methods that start and end with double underscores. They allow customization of class behavior. Examples include init, str, repr.<br>
• str and repr Methods in Python.<br>
• str: Returns a human-readable string representation of an object.<br>
• repr: Returns an unambiguous string representation of an object, often used for debugging.<br>
• len and getitem Methods in Python.<br>
• len: Returns the length of an object.<br>
• getitem: Retrieves an item from a collection using indexing.<br>
• add and sub Methods in Python.<br>
• add: Defines the behavior for the + operator.<br>
• sub: Defines the behavior for the - operator.<br>
• Class and Static Methods in Python.<br>
• Class methods: Defined using @classmethod, take cls as the first parameter, and can modify class state.<br>
• Static methods: Defined using @staticmethod, do not modify class or instance state.<br>
• @classmethod and @staticmethod Decorators in Python.<br>
• @classmethod: Used to define a method bound to the class and not the instance.<br>
• @staticmethod: Used to define a method that does not access or modify class or instance state.<br>
• Explain the difference between class variables and instance variables in Python.<br>
• Class variables: Shared by all instances of the class.<br>
• Instance variables: Unique to each instance.<br>
• Discuss the concept of method overriding and provide an example in Python. Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass.<br>

python

class Parent:
    def greet(self):
        print("Hello from Parent")

class Child(Parent):
    def greet(self):
        print("Hello from Child")
• How can you implement multiple inheritance in Python? Multiple inheritance can be implemented by defining a class that inherits from multiple base classes.<br>

python

class Parent1:
    pass

class Parent2:
    pass

class Child(Parent1, Parent2):
    pass
